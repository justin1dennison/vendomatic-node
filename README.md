# vendomatic

# How to get up and running:

I have implemented this in NodeJS. In order to get this working on your machine then you need to make sure that you have Node installed.
[NodeJS Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After completing that, then you can complete the following:

To explore with your favorite REST client:

```
cd vendomatic
npm install
npm run dev
```

To see some tests:

```
npm run test
```

**Notes**

- I did not utilize an true persistence layer.
